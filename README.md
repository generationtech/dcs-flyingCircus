<h2>MIST-based DCS script for spawning flights of random aircraft, liveries, aerodromes, and flightpaths.</h2>
<br>
Originally developed in 2014-2015 as a proof-of-concept to populate DCS server with interesting aircraft. At that time, the LUA intepreter in DCS seemed a bit limited and since it was running in a sandbox under the game engine, did not expose all the features of LUA. So this example is an all-in-one script with a lot of db info pasted into it from DCS source files.

Many of these same ideas from around the 2014-2015 time period seem to have made their way into the newer [MOOSE](https://github.com/FlightControl-Master/MOOSE) scripting API, <i>especially in the [RAT class](http://flightcontrol-master.github.io/MOOSE/Documentation/Rat.html)</i>
